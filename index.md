## Hello! Welcome to my blog

My name is Mauro Chojrin, I am a **technical coach for software development teams**. I help software development teams reach greater levels of excellence.

More specifically, I help software development teams reduce:

* **Number of bugs** that reach production
* **Lead time** (the time it takes to move from the PO's head to the users hands)
* **[Bus factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor)**
* **Software maintenance costs**

I do so by putting together hands-on workshops, sharing theoretical materials, participating in the teams day-to-day and working closely with the team leadership.

In this space I share some learnings gathered while working with my client's teams.

I hope you find [these essays](articles) useful.
