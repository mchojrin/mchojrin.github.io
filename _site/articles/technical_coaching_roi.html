<p>When an organization needs to make the decision to hire a technical coach the next question is: will this be a sensible investment? In other words, will there be a positive ROI?</p>

<p>This may seem like a hard question to answer but in reality it’s not so much. At the end of the day, it all boils down how much you could gain from your team being more effective at their job.</p>

<p>Think about it like this: a technical coach will help your team reduce the likelihood of bugs hitting production. What does this mean in terms of business value? A good way to think about this is to re-frame the question in terms of <strong>how much does it cost the company to have bugs hit production</strong>?</p>

<p>In order to answer that you need to factor a few items:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The cost of fixing the bug</li>
  <li>The cost of fixing the damage created by the bug</li>
  <li>The lost revenue</li>
  <li>The lost reputation</li>
</ul>

<p>And the list can go on and on. Probably not all of these apply to your particular situation, but certainly some will and, in any case, this should give you some ideas as to how to get fair basis for comparison against the cost of the technical coaching engagement.</p>

<p>Let’s look it from another angle: a technical coach will help the team increase deployment frequency. What does that have to do with any meaningful result for your business?</p>

<p>Well, if the team can deploy faster, that means your time to market will be reduced, which in turn means your company will be in a better competitive position.</p>

<p>So again, the questions you should ask yourself would be in the line of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>How much does it cost to have the new features delayed?</li>
  <li>How many more projects could be tackled by the team in the same time?</li>
</ul>

<p>In summary yes, bringing in a technical coach can mean a big investment but in order to make a good decision you need to look at both sides of the equation.</p>
