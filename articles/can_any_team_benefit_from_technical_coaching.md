Theoretically every team can benefit from a technical coaching engagement, I mean, what team is so good that it can't be better, right?

Of course, the real issue here is whether YOUR team can benefit from technical coaching or, more precisely, _how much_ benefit can your team derive from a technical coaching engagement.

So let's discuss that for a moment.

## What does a team need in order to get the most out of a technical coaching engagement?

The very first requirement for a team to benefit from technical coaching is for the team's tasks to be mostly about software development. If your team relies heavily on tools such as no-code or low-code platforms then technical coaching is most likely not the best way to invest your money.

Once that has been sorted out, the second issue to overcome is that of willingness to change. At the end of the day it doesn't really matter how good the workshops are or how interesting the exercises and such, if the team doesn't feel committed to improving their performance little will result from the engagement.

It is for this reason that the team, and by this I mean each member of the team, must feel the pain as their own. If the team doesn't feel they could (and should!) do better, it's very unlikely that they will put in the necessary effort to accomplish any meaningful goal.

## How to motivate a team to engage with the technical coach

The typical scenario is when someone high up in the organization is sensing the team's performance is less than ideal, but the team itself is not in alignment with this idea.

If this is the case, the first thing you can do is try to create a shared vision of how things will be better for each one once the team's performance improves. There are many ways to do this, and you can certainly count on the technical coach's help if you feel unsure on how to achieve this.

The point is, the stronger the emotional connection of the team with the end goal, the easier it will be for them to take the necessary steps to bridge the gap between the current state and the desired one.

Usually technical people take great pride in their work. Use that to your advantage. Show them how working alongside a technical coach will help them become better professionals.

At the same time, this has to be done with extreme care not to send the message that the team is not good enough and thus have a negative impact on the team's morale.

In order for the technical coaching engagement to be successful, it needs to be perceived as helpful in the eyes of the team from day one.

Finally, if everyone is in alignment with the end goal and the starting point, you're set up for a very enjoyable and lucrative experience.
