<body>
    <h1>Hello! Welcome to my blog</h1>
    <h2>I am Mauro Chojrin, technical coach for software development teams</h2>
    <p>In case you're wondering, the goal of a technical coaching engagement is to help software development teams reach greater levels of excellence.</p>
    <p>More specifically, I help software development teams:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Reduce the number of bugs that reach production</li>
        <li>Reduce the time it takes to move from the PO's head to the users hands</li>
        <li>Reduce the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor">bus factor</a></li>
        <li>Reduce software maintenance costs</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I do so by putting together hands-on workshops, sharing theoretical materials, participating in the teams day-to-day and working closely with the team leadership</p>
    <hr/>
    <p>In this space I'll be sharing some learnings gathered while working with software development teams as a Technical Coach.</p>
    <p>I hope you find these essays useful.</p>
